## **Scrapcode Modular - WONK**

https://www.scrapcode.co.uk

This code is designed to be uploaded to an ATMEGA328PU microcontroller using the Arduino IDE.
A WONK module can be created by installing this into a circuit built using the included schematics.
Both boards must be built and connected via the headers, or alternatively a single board with all compnonents could be created.

## **About WONK:**

WONK is a quad envelope generator with a twist!
 
Each envelope shares the same Attack and Release controls, but these can be further modified by the Wonk parameter:
 
More Wonk will make the top envelopes longer and the bottom envelopes shorter.
Less Wonk will make the top envelopes shorter and the bottom envelopes longer.
 
WONK can run in Attack-Release, Hold-Release or Looping modes.

AXIOM is available as either a DIY Kit or as a fully assembled product.
